## Xhwl

    Player: NPC
    Race: Gnoll
    Class: Ranger

Xhwl was among the original five members of the party, sent by the gnolls to
meet with Mankind.  He was killed during a weird event during a sandstorm,
only about a day before reaching Teber.  His companions brought him along and
handed him over to the humans to see if he could be raised.  They fled the
city before his body could be recovered.
